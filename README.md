## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called **DA161 - Create Your Analytics and Planning Applications in One Design-Time Artifcat.**

## Overview

This session consists of a series of exercises to introduce you to basics of SAP Analytics Cloud giving you the opportunity to interact with the latest visualizations, leverage basic planning capabilities, and learn to customize their dashboards using simple scripting all in a single user interface.

We've also included an opportunity for you to get an early hands-on preview, and can provide valuable feedback, with our new Optimized Story Experience which combines the simplicity of our traditional story-based dashboard and the extensibility of our existing analytics application building capabilities. 

## Overview

We will be using a provided SAP Analytics Cloud Tenant for these exercises. You can find a list of login credentials that will allow you to access the tenant under the User List.

Tenant URL (TBD): [TODO]
