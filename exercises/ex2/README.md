‚ÑπÔ∏è Welcome to Planning!

‚ÑπÔ∏è Welcome to Version Management! This is where you can manage any public/private versions that are associated with the data model. In this example, all versions are public, which means that the values are visible to other users. You can make changes directly on a public version or work with a private version instead.

3. First, let's make a private version of 23 Plan. Click on the **Copy** icon.

4. Rename the Version Name to **XX - 23 Plan**. XX can be replaced by your ID number.

5. Click **OK**

‚ÑπÔ∏è The private version that you just created now appears in the Version Management panel.

6. Click **Close**

7. You want to filter the story to only show data belonging to XX - 23 Plan. In the Version filter, select **XX - 23 Plan**.

üö© Now, you can start making changes to your data. To begin, let‚Äôs make some adjustments to raw material charges for BestBikes GmbH to account for some ongoing inflation pressures you are expecting specifically with suppliers in that region. 

8. First, click the **story filter** at the top panel. Click **BestBikes GmbH**.

9. In the Financial Account filter panel, click **Raw Materials**

üö© The planned changes to changes to raw material will not take effect until our new supply contract becomes active, which will occur after Q1/2023 (i.e. increases will not apply to the first three months of the year). 

10. Highlight the cells from January to March 2023.

11. Right click the highlighted cells and click Lock Cell. 

üö© By clicking Lock Cell, you are no longer able to apply edits and changes to the cells.

12. Now, you want to increase the raw material charges by 10% for the year 2023. Click into the value for 2023.

13. Type in +10% directly into the cell

‚ÑπÔ∏è Now, all the values are increased by 10% except for January 2023 to March 2023. This is because you have previously locked these cells. The increase in raw material charges are only applied to April 2023 to December 2023.
