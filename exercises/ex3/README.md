# Exercise 3 ‚Äì Integrating Scripting

**Objective:** You should develop a basic understanding of scripting capabilities in SAP Analytics Cloud.

**Estimated Time:** 20 mins

**Exercise Description:** In Exercise 2, our customers were able to execute planning actions. As they were working through the planning dashboard, they realized that they weren't sure what rates were being used for the calculations in the Financial Plan and Employee Plan. We want to provide them a better understanding of what those rates are by utilizing scripting capabilities in SAP Analytics Cloud.

**Key Features:**
* Understand how to add a popup in a dashboard
* Utilize a button to increase user interaction in a popup
* Write scripts to open and close a popup

üö© The Employee Rates Table provides us with an understanding of the rates that are used for calculations in the Financial Plan and Employee Plan. However, we want to access the Employee Rates Table in an easier way. In order to do that, we want to provide a jumpoff point in the Employee Plan Table that can show us the rates.

3. First, we want to copy the table. Right click into the Table and click **Copy**. Alternatively, we can also press **Ctrl+C**.
